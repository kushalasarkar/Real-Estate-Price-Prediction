In this project, we had predicted the sales price of the houses using various machine learning algorithms.
Housing sales price are determined by numerous factors such as area of the property, location of the house, number of bedrooms, bathrooms and so on.

Here, machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression technique and Decision Tree are used to build a predictive model.
